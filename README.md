**Title: Pakistan Voting System**

**Introduction:**
This project is a Voting System aimed at modernizing and securing the election process in Pakistan. The existing voting system is outdated and prone to corruption. To address these issues and leverage modern technology, this project provides a platform with two distinct roles: Admin and Voter. Candidates can vote but are restricted from editing votes or viewing results before they are finalized.

**Description:**
When the system opens, the first page asks the user to select their role: Voter or Admin. The appropriate page will be rendered based on the selection. In future deployments, the system will ensure that voters see only the voter page, where they can enter their CNIC and cast their vote. Importantly, a voter will not be able to cast a vote without fingerprint verification, ensuring security and authenticity.
